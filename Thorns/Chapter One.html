<p>The lion lounged on his side, tongue lolling in the savannah's midday heat.</p>
 <p>Seff had just reached his full size and was on the hunt for lionesses in order to start his own pride. 
<br>But who could think of family matters on such a scorcher of a day?</p>
<p>Already drowsing, he turned onto his stomach- and yelped loudly as a thorn dug into his skin.</p>
<p>***<br> What on Urth? Mousen paused in her careful seed sorting. "What kind of beast would 
be making so much noise- at noon?"<br>Not being a particularly timid mouse, she resolved to find out.</p>

<p>***<br>"Of all the luck!" Seff grumbled. The thorn was big enough to be painful, but small enough that he couldn't 
grasp it properly in his teeth.</p>
<p>"Just great- a fine state of affairs! Why- Oh, excuse me, madam."</p>
<p>The mouse smiled, sitting back on her haunches.</p>
